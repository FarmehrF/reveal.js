# **IF** Idea Exploring



## Child Abuse
### *Analyzing the problem*
For getting to the bottom of this we could look at this problem from 3 different viewpoints.
 - Parents who are doing this act
 - Children who are a victim of this act and will be the parents of the future
 - People who are witnesses to this act and wanna do something about it


### *Possible Solutions*
#### Parents
For the parents we could cure this problem through raising awareness and creating a new cultural standpoint, this could be achieved through a public medium like
 - TV Commercials
 - Social Media and Social Approve
 - Maybe some kind of the game that main message is that the solution isn't always in anger and force
 - A service or game which will be played in the work office atmosphere that main objective is to put guilt on the ones who use force and violence


#### Kids
Although that damages done to children can hardly be cured we could teach them to talk to each other and especially someone professional about this topic
 - A game that encourages them to speak to others about their problems they can get through the game by cooperating with each other and telling them about their hidden problems
 - A Social Media Platform that people can talk about this topic and their problems there freely and anonymously
 - I think a more in-depth look into products like stress balls could be beneficial for this matter



## Mental Health Issues During Pandemic


### *Sources*
Being isolated during the time of this pandemic and for a lot of us not seeing our friends and family created some sort of depression which we talked about
 - Being alone in our homes
 - Not Communicating with new people
 - Losing Motivation 
 - Not eating healthy and lack of body exercises


### *Possible Solutions*
Alright so creating an app that people can talk to each other anonymously seems to be the theme of today because I think this idea could be really supportive for people who just wanna talk to somebody and express their feeling and I think keeping track of people mental health and body health through some questions in the app could go a long way because we could use that data to connect people that have problems with the ones that passed it and wanna help others and these communications could be leading to some sort of credit to encourage them to use the app more. 


#### *but Where did the credits come from?*
Well this question could be easily answered by setting up a payment system and using that monthly money they feed people back but we could think of other solutions like taking money from the government and COVID aids

but other than the app we have a couple of other options here like creating a product that connects to a chair and tracks your productivity and upper body weights and there are workouts included


#### Mind Reader
With muse products that can track your brain waves and improve the quality of your meditation, we could see that feature of this kind of devices are very bright so we could use this to our advantage and create product and headphone that tracks your brain waves and whenever you feel stressed your screen will be blocked and you will be forced to meditate



## Families Health 
### *Sources*
Distanced families are a growing problem and with COVID lockdown this topic is hotter than ever with people being locked in their homes they have to learn to co-operate with each other 


### *Possible Solutions*
Solution of this problem can be achieved in many ways but just to name a few could be games and family activities that encourage people to see things through other people lenses or maybe just products that bring laughter and stupidity to homes
